          <h3>Observations between health and social factors</h3>
          <p>There is a strong positive corellation between states with increased levels of poverty and reduced access to health care. Similarly as poverty increases
            so does obesity and percentage smoking. Given the corellations between these factors it would suggest that access to healthcare and education regarding the perils of
            obesity and smoking needs to be improved for the vulnerable poor in society. Wealthier states had higher healthcare coverage as well as fewer citizens being 
            obese and smoking which highlights the inequities of wealth distribution and healthcare

          <h3>Observations between age and health risks</h3>
          <p>Median age varies state by state so it is challenging to make any firm observations on the data being presented. One can infer
            that wealthier states have higher median ages than poorer states which given the previous observation further indicates th importance of improving healthcare.
            THis data also shows that not all states are equal in terms of median age with a broad range of medians from 30.5 in Utah to 44.1 in Maine. The mode of the median ages
            occur in a central distribution to this but comparing median age to health risks has been inconclusive with this data set
